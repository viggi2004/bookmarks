# bookmarks

App hosted at http://balavignesh.me:3000/app

Directions:

1. Create bookmarks
2. Create folders
3. Click and drag the navicon near the title text box and drop it on any folders that you created
4. Current directory is shown in the navbar
5. Double click the folder to view its contents

Note: You cannot view the bookmarks inside a folder until you refresh the page atleast once after creating the folder. Its a bug and I'm working on it
